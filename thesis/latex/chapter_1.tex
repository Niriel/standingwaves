Explain interference.

Explain cavity.

Explain coherence.
Introduce coherence time, coherence length.

Show that incoherent system do not have to care.

Describe the HIFI instrument.
Heterodyne, double sideband, sideband ratio.

Show that, even though the astronomical light and the thermal noise of the HIFI instrument are a priori incoherent, they are coherent enough for our purpose because of the very narrow bandwith of every channel in out spectrometer.

Conclude that any method in this thesis can be applied to any coherent system.  Lasers are good candidates.
