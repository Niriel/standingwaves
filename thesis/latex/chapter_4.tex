This is a tough part.  Now, we are trying to quatitatively predict what HIFI does.

We need the best knowledge of the instrument.
Someone must really sit with me to help me translate all these matcad files into values I can use in my code.
Some parameters come from design, some from measure, and some are guesses.

HIFI has 7 bands.  I must therefore produce 7 systems.  

Try to reproduce some of the calibration observations we took on January.  There are diplexer scans that should help with the phase factor of the reflection coefficient of the LO and mixer, and there are observations of a CO line to constrain the sideband ratio.

There is much fitting to be done.
