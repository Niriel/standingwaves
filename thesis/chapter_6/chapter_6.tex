Plane wave expansion to generalize to gaussian beams?
See Siegman Lasers, page 658.
Trick is: use plane waves with slightly different directions.
So stop using any "normal" element in the design and start really calculating all the Snell stuff.
Also: infinite amount of plane waves?  Can't we use a more discrete version with only a few components, like a Fourier Series instead of a Fourier transform?
